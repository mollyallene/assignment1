  <h1>What We Do</h1>
  <p> The Rainforest Foundation works on-the-ground to secure land rights for indigenous people.
      We strengthen indigenous land security and train indigenous communities to use technology to protect their forests.
      By investing directly in indigenous communities, we connect people who are deeply motivated
      to conserve their ancestral lands with the tools, training, and resources necessary to protect their rainforests.
