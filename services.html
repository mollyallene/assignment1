  <h1>What We Do</h1>
  <p> The Rainforest Foundation works on-the-ground to secure land rights for indigenous people.
      We strengthen indigenous land security and train indigenous communities to use technology to protect their forests.
      By investing directly in indigenous communities, we connect people who are deeply motivated
      to conserve their ancestral lands with the tools, training, and resources necessary to protect their rainforests.
  </p>
  <h2>We:</h2>
  <p> 
    -Supply legal and technical support so that indigenous communities have the information needed to make decisions and influence public policy.
  </br>
    -Build networks of indigenous technical experts who manage and analyze satellite data, monitor their forests and take action to keep illegal loggers, miners, and traffickers off of their ancestral lands.  
  </br>
    -Support leaders and indigenous institutions, the cornerstone of effective advocacy and community-based conservation. 
  </br>
    -Provide on-the-ground equipment and training to partners so they can use smartphone, drone and satellite technology in defense of their land.
